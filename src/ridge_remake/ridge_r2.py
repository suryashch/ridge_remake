def ridge_get_r2(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculate the coefficient of determination (R² score) for a regression model.
    
    The R² score measures how well the regression line fits the data, representing
    the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from
    the independent variable(s). Values range from -∞ to 1, where 1 indicates
    perfect prediction.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        True target values (observed data points).
    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted values from the regression model.
    
    Returns
    -------
    r2 : float
        The R² score. A value of 1.0 indicates perfect prediction, 0.0 indicates
        the model performs no better than predicting the mean, and negative values
        indicate the model performs worse than a horizontal line at the mean.
    
    Notes
    -----
    R² is calculated as:
        R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
    where:
        SS_res = Σ(y_true - y_pred)²  (residual sum of squares)
        SS_tot = Σ(y_true - ȳ)²       (total sum of squares)
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> y_true = np.array([3, -0.5, 2, 7])
    >>> y_pred = np.array([2.5, 0.0, 2, 8])
    >>> ridge_scatter_r2(y_true, y_pred)
